                            Here is where I officially started my coding journey. At scrimba, I learned mainly front end languages, such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.js.<br />
                            I learned how to build simple projects; Scrimba helped me build this website.

                        <p>I decided to go through a coding bootcamp with Futureproof to learn more about coding. Futureproof really helped me develop my front end developer skills. <br />
                        I also learned back end javascript, SQL, No-SQL, MongoDB and also learned how to do testing and use Docker.
                        I have combined all the skills I have learned and have build projects with my colleagues</p>
